# Manga_Reader

Supposed to be a Simple API backend for a folder that contains manga in zip (zip/cbz) format.

# Why?

Every other Manga_Reader tries to automagically arrage everything, I don't want such a thing, and there was no good open source alternatives that I could find and host on my raspi server.

This also serves as something primitive to learn and enjoy the Rust programming language.
